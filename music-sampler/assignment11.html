  <h1> The Foo Fighters Keep Fighting </h1>
<p class="intro"> Dave Grohl struck lightning twice. First, Grohl was the drummer in 90s supernova Nirvana. Following Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, Grohl pursued a solo project called Foo Fighters in 1994. The name comes from the name of UFOs reported by World War II pilots. In this new project, Grohl played the lead guitar and sang. Currently, the band has six members, Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Taylor Hawkins, Chris Shiflett and Rami Jaffee. Over 20 years, the Foo Fighters has released nine studio albums. The band has won 11 Grammy Awards has sold 12 million copies in the United States alone. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters">Find out more here</a></p>
